Allows to define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.

# Problem

Imagine that you have two types of objects: a `Customer` and a `Store`. The customer is very interested in a particular brand of product (say, it’s a new model of the iPhone) which should become available in the store very soon.

The customer could visit the store every day and check product availability. But while the product is still en route, most of these trips would be pointless.

On the other hand, the store could send tons of emails (which might be considered spam) to all customers each time a new product becomes available. This would save some customers from endless trips to the store. At the same time, it’d upset other customers who aren’t interested in new products.

It looks like we’ve got a conflict. Either the customer wastes time checking product availability or the store wastes resources notifying the wrong customers.

# Solution

The object that has some interesting state is often called _subject_, but since it’s also going to notify other objects about the changes to its state, we’ll call it _publisher_. All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher’s state are called _subscribers_.

The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. Fear not! Everything isn’t as complicated as it sounds. In reality, this mechanism consists of 1) an array field for storing a list of references to subscriber objects and 2) several public methods which allow adding subscribers to and removing them from that list.

Now, whenever an important event happens to the publisher, it goes over its subscribers and calls the specific notification method on their objects.

Real apps might have dozens of different subscriber classes that are interested in tracking events of the same publisher class. You wouldn’t want to couple the publisher to all of those classes. Besides, you might not even know about some of them beforehand if your publisher class is supposed to be used by other people.

That’s why it’s crucial that all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification.

If your app has several different types of publishers and you want to make your subscribers compatible with all of them, you can go even further and make all publishers follow the same interface. This interface would only need to describe a few subscription methods. The interface would allow subscribers to observe publishers’ states without coupling to their concrete classes.

# Structure

![[Observer Diagram.png]]

1. The **Publisher** issues events of interest to other objects. These events occur when the publisher changes its state or executes some behaviors. Publishers contain a subscription infrastructure that lets new subscribers join and current subscribers leave the list.
2. When a new event happens, the publisher goes over the subscription list and calls the notification method declared in the subscriber interface on each subscriber object.
3. The **Subscriber** interface declares the notification interface. In most cases, it consists of a single `update` method. The method may have several parameters that let the publisher pass some event details along with the update.
4. **Concrete Subscribers** perform some actions in response to notifications issued by the publisher. All of these classes must implement the same interface so the publisher isn’t coupled to concrete classes.
5. Usually, subscribers need some contextual information to handle the update correctly. For this reason, publishers often pass some context data as arguments of the notification method. The publisher can pass itself as an argument, letting subscriber fetch any required data directly.
6. The **Client** creates publisher and subscriber objects separately and then registers subscribers for publisher updates.

# Applicability

- [i] When changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
- [i] When some objects in the app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.

# Pros and Cons

- [p] [[Open Closed Principle]]. Can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher's code (and vice versa if there's a publishers interface).
- [p] Can establish relations between objects at runtime.
- [c] Subscribers are notified in random order.

# Relations with Other Patterns

- [[Chain of Responsibility]] [[Command]], [[Mediator]] and Observer address various ways of connecting senders and receivers of requests:
    - _Chain of Responsibility_ passes a request sequentially along a dynamic chain of potential receivers until one of them handles it.
    - _Command_ establishes unidirectional connections between senders and receivers.
    - _Mediator_ eliminates direct connections between senders and receivers, forcing them to communicate indirectly via a mediator object.
    - _Observer_ lets receivers dynamically subscribe to and unsubscribe from receiving requests.
- The difference between [[Mediator]] and Observer is often elusive. In most cases, you can implement either of these patterns; but sometimes you can apply both simultaneously. Let’s see how we can do that.
    The primary goal of _Mediator_ is to eliminate mutual dependencies among a set of system  components. Instead, these components become dependent on a single mediator object. The goal of _Observer_ is to establish dynamic one-way connections between objects, where some objects act as subordinates of others.
    There’s a popular implementation of the _Mediator_ pattern that relies on _Observer_. The  mediator object plays the role of publisher, and the components act as subscribers which subscribe to and unsubscribe from the mediator’s events. When _Mediator_ is implemented this way, it may look very similar to _Observer_.
    When you’re confused, remember that you can implement the Mediator pattern in other ways. For example, you can permanently link all the components to the same mediator object. This implementation won’t resemble _Observer_ but will still be an instance of the Mediator pattern.
    Now imagine a program where all components have become publishers, allowing dynamic  connections between each other. There won’t be a centralized mediator object, only a distributed set of observers.

# Implementation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;

{
    public interface IObserver
    {
        // Receive update from subject
        void Update(ISubject subject);
    }

    public interface ISubject
    {
        // Attach an observer to the subject.
        void Attach(IObserver observer);

        // Detach an observer from the subject.
        void Detach(IObserver observer);

        // Notify all observers about an event.
        void Notify();
    }

    // The Subject owns some important state and notifies observers when the
    // state changes.
    public class Subject : ISubject
    {
        // For the sake of simplicity, the Subject's state, essential to all
        // subscribers, is stored in this variable.
        public int State { get; set; } = -0;

        // List of subscribers. In real life, the list of subscribers can be
        // stored more comprehensively (categorized by event type, etc.).
        private List<IObserver> _observers = new List<IObserver>();

        // The subscription management methods.
        public void Attach(IObserver observer)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: Attached an observer.");
            this._observers.Add(observer);
        }

        public void Detach(IObserver observer)
        {
            this._observers.Remove(observer);
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: Detached an observer.");
        }

        // Trigger an update in each subscriber.
        public void Notify()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: Notifying observers...");

            foreach (var observer in _observers)
            {
                observer.Update(this);
            }
        }

        // Usually, the subscription logic is only a fraction of what a Subject
        // can really do. Subjects commonly hold some important business logic,
        // that triggers a notification method whenever something important is
        // about to happen (or after it).
        public void SomeBusinessLogic()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\nSubject: I'm doing something important.");
            this.State = new Random().Next(0, 10);

            Thread.Sleep(15);

            Console.WriteLine("Subject: My state has just changed to: " + this.State);
            this.Notify();
        }
    }

    // Concrete Observers react to the updates issued by the Subject they had
    // been attached to.
    class ConcreteObserverA : IObserver
    {
        public void Update(ISubject subject)
        {            
            if ((subject as Subject).State < 3)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ConcreteObserverA: Reacted to the event.");
            }
        }
    }

    class ConcreteObserverB : IObserver
    {
        public void Update(ISubject subject)
        {
            if ((subject as Subject).State == 0 || (subject as Subject).State >= 2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ConcreteObserverB: Reacted to the event.");
            }
        }
    }
    
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // The client code.
            var subject = new Subject();
            var observerA = new ConcreteObserverA();
            subject.Attach(observerA);

            var observerB = new ConcreteObserverB();
            subject.Attach(observerB);

            subject.SomeBusinessLogic();
            subject.SomeBusinessLogic();

            subject.Detach(observerB);

            subject.SomeBusinessLogic();
        }
    }
}
