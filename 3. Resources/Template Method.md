Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass, but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

# Problem

Imagine that you’re creating a data mining application that analyzes corporate documents. Users feed the app documents in various formats (PDF, DOC, CSV), and it tries to extract meaningful data from these docs in a uniform format.

The first version of the app could work only with DOC files. In the following version, it was able to support CSV files. A month later, you “taught” it to extract data from PDF files.

At some point, you noticed that all three classes have a lot of similar code. While the code for dealing with various data formats was entirely different in all classes, the code for data processing and analysis is almost identical. Wouldn’t it be great to get rid of the code duplication, leaving the algorithm structure intact?

There was another problem related to client code that used these classes. It had lots of conditionals that picked a proper course of action depending on the class of the processing object. If all three processing classes had a common interface or a base class, you’d be able to eliminate the conditionals in client code and use polymorphism when calling methods on a processing object.

# Solution

The Template Method pattern suggests that you break down an algorithm into a series of steps, turn these steps into methods, and put a series of calls to these methods inside a single _template method._ The steps may either be `abstract`, or have some default implementation. To use the algorithm, the client is supposed to provide its own subclass, implement all abstract steps, and override some of the optional ones if needed (but not the template method itself).

Let’s see how this will play out in our data mining app. We can create a base class for all three parsing algorithms. This class defines a template method consisting of a series of calls to various document-processing steps.

At first, we can declare all steps `abstract`, forcing the subclasses to provide their own implementations for these methods. In our case, subclasses already have all necessary implementations, so the only thing we might need to do is adjust signatures of the methods to match the methods of the superclass.

Now, let’s see what we can do to get rid of the duplicate code. It looks like the code for opening/closing files and extracting/parsing data is different for various data formats, so there’s no point in touching those methods. However, implementation of other steps, such as analyzing the raw data and composing reports, is very similar, so it can be pulled up into the base class, where subclasses can share that code.

As you can see, we’ve got two types of steps:

- _abstract steps_ must be implemented by every subclass
- _optional steps_ already have some default implementation, but still can be overridden if needed

There’s another type of step, called _hooks_. A hook is an optional step with an empty body. A template method would work even if a hook isn’t overridden. Usually, hooks are placed before and after crucial steps of algorithms, providing subclasses with additional extension points for an algorithm.

# Structure

![[Template Method Diagram.png]]
1. The **Abstract Class** declares methods that act as steps of an algorithm, as well as the actual template method which calls these methods in a specific order. The steps may either be declared `abstract` or have some default implementation.
2. **Concrete Classes** can override all of the steps, but not the template method itself.

# Applicability

- [i] For letting clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm, but not the whole algorithm or its structure.
- [i] When there are several classes that contain almost identical algorithms with some minor differences. As a result, it might be necessary to modify all classes when the algorithm changes.

# Pros and Cons

- [p] Can let clients override only certain parts of a large algorithm, making them less affected by changes that happen to other parts of the algorithm.
- [p] Can pull the duplicate code into a superclass.
- [c] Some clients may be limited by the provided skeleton of an algorithm.
- [c] Might violate the [[Liskov Substitution Principle]] by suppressing a default step implementation via a subclass.
- [c] Template methods tend to be harder to maintain the more steps they have.

# Relations with Other Patterns

- [[Factory Method]] is a specialization of Template Method. At the same time, a _Factory Method_ may serve as a step in a large _Template Method_.
- Template Method is based on inheritance: it lets you alter parts of an algorithm by extending those parts in subclasses. [[Strategy]] is based on composition: you can alter parts of the object’s behavior by supplying it with different strategies that correspond to that behavior. _Template Method_ works at the class level, so it’s static. _Strategy_ works on the object level, letting you switch behaviors at runtime.
# Implementation

```csharp
using System;

{
    // The Abstract Class defines a template method that contains a skeleton of
    // some algorithm, composed of calls to (usually) abstract primitive
    // operations.
    //
    // Concrete subclasses should implement these operations, but leave the
    // template method itself intact.
    abstract class AbstractClass
    {
        // The template method defines the skeleton of an algorithm.
        public void TemplateMethod()
        {
            this.BaseOperation1();
            this.RequiredOperations1();
            this.BaseOperation2();
            this.Hook1();
            this.RequiredOperation2();
            this.BaseOperation3();
            this.Hook2();
        }

        // These operations already have implementations.
        protected void BaseOperation1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("AbstractClass says: I am doing the bulk of the work");
        }

        protected void BaseOperation2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("AbstractClass says: But I let subclasses override some operations");
        }

        protected void BaseOperation3()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("AbstractClass says: But I am doing the bulk of the work anyway");
        }
        
        // These operations have to be implemented in subclasses.
        protected abstract void RequiredOperations1();

        protected abstract void RequiredOperation2();
        
        // These are "hooks." Subclasses may override them, but it's not
        // mandatory since the hooks already have default (but empty)
        // implementation. Hooks provide additional extension points in some
        // crucial places of the algorithm.
        protected virtual void Hook1() { }

        protected virtual void Hook2() { }
    }

    // Concrete classes have to implement all abstract operations of the base
    // class. They can also override some operations with a default
    // implementation.
    class ConcreteClass1 : AbstractClass
    {
        protected override void RequiredOperations1()
        {

        {
            Console.WriteLine("ConcreteClass1 says: Implemented Operation2");
        }
    }

    // Usually, concrete classes override only a fraction of base class'
    // operations.
    class ConcreteClass2 : AbstractClass
    {

        {
            Console.WriteLine("ConcreteClass2 says: Implemented Operation1");
        }

        }

        protected override void Hook1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("ConcreteClass2 says: Overridden Hook1");
        }
    }

    class Client
    {
        // The client code calls the template method to execute the algorithm.
        // Client code does not have to know the concrete class of an object it
        // works with, as long as it works with objects through the interface of
        // their base class.
        public static void ClientCode(AbstractClass abstractClass)
