Lets separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

# Problem

Imagine that your team develops an app which works with geographic information structured as one colossal graph. Each node of the graph may represent a complex entity such as a city, but also more granular things like industries, sightseeing areas, etc. The nodes are connected with others if there’s a road between the real objects that they represent. Under the hood, each node type is represented by its own class, while each specific node is an object.

At some point, you got a task to implement exporting the graph into XML format. At first, the job seemed pretty straightforward. You planned to add an export method to each node class and then leverage recursion to go over each node of the graph, executing the export method. The solution was simple and elegant: thanks to polymorphism, you weren’t coupling the code which called the export method to concrete classes of nodes.

Unfortunately, the system architect refused to allow you to alter existing node classes. He said that the code was already in production and he didn’t want to risk breaking it because of a potential bug in your changes.

Besides, he questioned whether it makes sense to have the XML export code within the node classes. The primary job of these classes was to work with geodata. The XML export behavior would look alien there.

There was another reason for the refusal. It was highly likely that after this feature was implemented, someone from the marketing department would ask you to provide the ability to export into a different format, or request some other weird stuff. This would force you to change those precious and fragile classes again.

# Solution

The Visitor pattern suggests that you place the new behavior into a separate class called _visitor_, instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior is now passed to one of the visitor’s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within the object.

Now, what if that behavior can be executed over objects of different classes? For example, in our case with XML export, the actual implementation will probably be a little bit different across various node classes. Thus, the visitor class may define not one, but a set of methods, each of which could take arguments of different types.

But how exactly would we call these methods, especially when dealing with the whole graph? These methods have different signatures, so we can’t use polymorphism. To pick a proper visitor method that’s able to process a given object, we’d need to check its class. Doesn’t this sound like a nightmare?

You might ask, why don’t we use method overloading? That’s when you give all methods the same name, even if they support different sets of parameters. Unfortunately, even assuming that our programming language supports it at all (as Java and C# do), it won’t help us. Since the exact class of a node object is unknown in advance, the overloading mechanism won’t be able to determine the correct method to execute. It’ll default to the method that takes an object of the base `Node` class.

However, the Visitor pattern addresses this problem. It uses a technique called [Double Dispatch](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor-double-dispatch), which helps to execute the proper method on an object without cumbersome conditionals. Instead of letting the client select a proper version of the method to call, how about we delegate this choice to objects we’re passing to the visitor as an argument? Since the objects know their own classes, they’ll be able to pick a proper method on the visitor less awkwardly. They “accept” a visitor and tell it what visiting method should be executed.

# Structure

![[Visitor Diagram.png]]
1. The **Visitor** interface declares a set of visiting methods that can take concrete elements of an object structure as arguments. These methods may have the same names if the program is written in a language that supports overloading, but the type of their parameters must be different.
2. Each **Concrete Visitor** implements several versions of the same behaviors, tailored for different concrete element classes.
3. The **Element** interface declares a method for “accepting” visitors. This method should have one parameter declared with the type of the visitor interface.
4. Each **Concrete Element** must implement the acceptance method. The purpose of this method is to redirect the call to the proper visitor’s method corresponding to the current element class. Be aware that even if a base element class implements this method, all subclasses must still override this method in their own classes and call the appropriate method on the visitor object.
5. The **Client** usually represents a collection or some other complex object (for example, a [[Composite]] tree). Usually, clients aren’t aware of all the concrete element classes because they work with objects from that collection via some abstract interface.

# Applicability

- [i] When it's needed to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure.
- [i] Clean up business logic of auxiliary behaviors.
- [i] Behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.

# Pros and Cons

- [p] [[Open Closed Principle]]. Can introduce a new behavior that can work with objects of different classes without changing these classes.
- [p] [[Single Responsibility Principle]]. Can move multiple versions of the same behavior into the same class.
- [p] A visitor object can accumulate some useful information while working with various objects. This might be handy when it' necessary to traverse some complex object structure, such as an object tree, and apply the visitor to each object of this structure.
- [c] It's needed to update all visitors each time a class gets added or removed from the element hierarchy.
- [c] Visitors might lack the necessary access to the private fields and methods of the elements that they're supposed to work with.

# Relations with Other Patterns

- You can treat Visitor as a powerful version of the [[Command]] pattern. Its objects can execute operations over various objects of different classes.
    
- You can use Visitor to execute an operation over an entire [[Composite]] tree.
    
- You can use Visitor along with [[Iterator]] to traverse a complex data structure and execute some operation over its elements, even if they all have different classes.
# Implementation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

{
    // The Component interface declares an `accept` method that should take the
    // base visitor interface as an argument.
    public interface IComponent
    {
        void Accept(IVisitor visitor);
    }

    // Each Concrete Component must implement the `Accept` method in such a way
    // that it calls the visitor's method corresponding to the component's
    // class.
    public class ConcreteComponentA : IComponent
    {
        // Note that we're calling `VisitConcreteComponentA`, which matches the
        // current class name. This way we let the visitor know the class of the
        // component it works with.
        public void Accept(IVisitor visitor)
        {
            visitor.VisitConcreteComponentA(this);
        }

        // Concrete Components may have special methods that don't exist in
        // their base class or interface. The Visitor is still able to use these
        // methods since it's aware of the component's concrete class.
        public string ExclusiveMethodOfConcreteComponentA()
        {
            return "A";
        }
    }

    public class ConcreteComponentB : IComponent
    {
        // Same here: VisitConcreteComponentB => ConcreteComponentB
        public void Accept(IVisitor visitor)
        {
            visitor.VisitConcreteComponentB(this);
        }

        public string SpecialMethodOfConcreteComponentB()
        {
            return "B";
        }
    }

    // The Visitor Interface declares a set of visiting methods that correspond
    // to component classes. The signature of a visiting method allows the
    // visitor to identify the exact class of the component that it's dealing
    // with.
    public interface IVisitor
    {
        void VisitConcreteComponentA(ConcreteComponentA element);

        void VisitConcreteComponentB(ConcreteComponentB element);
    }

    // Concrete Visitors implement several versions of the same algorithm, which
    // can work with all concrete component classes.
    //
    // You can experience the biggest benefit of the Visitor pattern when using
    // it with a complex object structure, such as a Composite tree. In this
    // case, it might be helpful to store some intermediate state of the
    // algorithm while executing visitor's methods over various objects of the
    // structure.
    class ConcreteVisitor1 : IVisitor
    {
        public void VisitConcreteComponentA(ConcreteComponentA element)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(element.ExclusiveMethodOfConcreteComponentA() + " + ConcreteVisitor1");
        }

        public void VisitConcreteComponentB(ConcreteComponentB element)

    {
        public void VisitConcreteComponentA(ConcreteComponentA element)
        {

        {
            Console.WriteLine(element.SpecialMethodOfConcreteComponentB() + " + ConcreteVisitor2");
        }
    }

    public class Client
    {
        // The client code can run visitor operations over any set of elements
        // without figuring out their concrete classes. The accept operation
        // directs a call to the appropriate operation in the visitor object.
        public static void ClientCode(List<IComponent> components, IVisitor visitor)
        {
            foreach (var component in components)
            {
                component.Accept(visitor);
            }
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<IComponent> components = new List<IComponent>
            {
                new ConcreteComponentA(),
                new ConcreteComponentB()
            };

            Console.WriteLine("The client code works with all visitors via the base Visitor interface:");
            var visitor1 = new ConcreteVisitor1();
            Client.ClientCode(components,visitor1);

            Console.WriteLine();

            Console.WriteLine("It allows the same client code to work with different types of visitors:");
            var visitor2 = new ConcreteVisitor2();
            Client.ClientCode(components, visitor2);
        }
    }
