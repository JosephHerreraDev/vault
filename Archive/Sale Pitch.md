Hi, my name is Joseph from Herrerasoft. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?

Thanks, `Name`. I’ll keep this quick — I just need five minutes to show you something that could really simplify how your dealership runs. Is this a good time?

Herrerasoft offers a Dealer Management System that covers everything the government requires and everything your business needs — from handling paperwork and payments to tracking inventory and customers.

Out of curiosity, after you close a sale, how long does it usually take to finish all the paperwork and finalize everything?

Got it. With our system, you could cut that time in half and save hours every week — meaning more sales and less stress.

And it’s only $400 per year, all included. Would you be open to a quick demo later this week so you can see how it fits your operation?

That’s great to hear, `Name`. To get you started, we simply charge the annual $400 fee, handle the installation, and walk you through a live demo so you can start using it right away.

Payment is processed securely online, and setup takes less than an hour.  
Would you like to schedule your installation and demo today, or would tomorrow work better?

Once it’s running, you’ll have full support from us throughout the year.

- Slow down on important points
- Ask more questions if they have a system right now
- Keep the tone friendly
