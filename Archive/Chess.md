# Opening repertoire

- Prepare responses to common moves
- 1. E4 = Tactical play, Open positions
- 1. D4 = Positional play, Solid positions
- If weird response, control center, develop pieces
- Rules:
	1. Control the center
	2. Develop all the pieces 
	3. Castle in the first 10 moves
- Not to do:
	- Move same piece multiple times
	- Push too many pawns
	- Take queen out too early
	- pointless moves

# Always ask what is the opponent threatening

# Don't trade Bishop for a knight without a good reason

# Master clock timing

- Don't overthink the obvious (forced move, capture,...)
- Play opening quickly
- Utilize opponent's turn to think about strategy
- Save time for the middlegame

# Learn the coordinates

# Counterattack and don't be passive

# Use the elimination method to calculate

- Candidate moves and their responses
- Ignore weak candidate moves
1. Find 2/4 candidate moves
2. Checks -> captures -> attacks
3. Eliminate the weakest candidates
