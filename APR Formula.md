# Returning result
**(i)** In this case, no further iterations are required to obtain the annual percentage rate correct to two decimal places, 12.83%.

**(ii)** When the iteration approach is used, it is expected that calculators or computers will be programmed to carry all available decimals throughout the calculation and that enough iterations will be performed to make virtually certain that the annual percentage rate obtained, when rounded to 2 decimals, is correct. Annual percentage rates in the examples below were obtained by using a 10 digit programmable calculator and the iteration procedure described above.
