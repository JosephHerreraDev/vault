They are solutions to common problems that happen in software design. They are like pre-built blueprints that can be personalized to solve a common design problem in the code.

A pattern can't be copied and paste in the code like a function or prepared library. The pattern is not an specific portion of code, but a general concept to solve a particular problem. It can be followed to adapt to an specific implementation in code.

It's different from an algorithm in the sense that an algorithm is like a recipe, follow instructions step by step to get a product. The design patterns in the other hand, are like a blueprint where one can look at the result and functions, and the implementation order is not important.

# That does a pattern consist of?
- Purpose: Briefly explain the problem and solution
- Motivation: Explain in greater detail the problem and the solution given by the pattern.
- Structure: Each part of the pattern and how they interact.
- Code example: Implementation in C#
